                        <h2>SOSHIN MARY LAHEEN</h2>
                        <p>Soshin Mary Laheen Roshi is our resident teacher at Earth+Sky Zen. She is an authorised teacher in the Maezumi lineage and member of the White Plum Asanga. She received dharma transmission from her teacher Jinsen Robert Kennedy Roshi in 2019 at a ceremony in Dublin, to teach and transmit the Dharma of the Buddha. In 2025 she was made a Roshi by Jinsen.
Mary began practicing zen in the mid 1990s with Alain Tainan Liebmann, a zen teacher in the Deshimaru lineage, who came to Ireland in 1991. She took Jukai in 1998 and received Tokudo ordination from Alain in 2003. From that time she was the person responsible for the Dublin Dojo, which was founded by Alain in 1996.
She lived at Gotanjoji Temple in Fukui Province, Japan in the Autumn of 2008 and received Tokudo in the Sotoshu tradition from Itabashi Zenji there in September of that

                        <h2>ZAZEN</h2>
                        <p>The foundation of zen practice is zazen, the Japanese word means ´sitting meditation’, it is  the practice of being here now, of sitting in this present moment. We sit together in the dojo, also called a zendo, and we practice zazen together in a structured and supportive environment. Here at Earth+Sky we have a daily, a weekly and a yearly cycle of events, all centered around the practice of zazen but including other connected activities.</p>

                        <h2>EARTH+SKY</h2>
                        <p>Each day, we chant the Heart Sutra as it is chanted throughout the Buddhist world. In this ancient verse, sitting meditation is called the ´perfection of wisdom practice´ because it allows us to realize that only this fleeting present moment is real, all else is empty of substance, is delusion. We can neither undo the past nor control the future, but we can bring our whole hearted attention to the present. In this present moment we realize that we exist only in interconnection with all beings and all things. And that interconnection includes everything: our cultural and spiritual background; our location today, the weather, the amount of daylight, our position relative to the sun, everything……..</p>

                        <p>From a Buddhist perspective, a human being is subject to the three poisons: Greed; Hatred; and Ignorance, which cause us to chase what we want and run from what we don´t want. When we look outwards towards the world we see the three poisons writ large across the globe. These are pushing us towards environmental catastrophe, and involving us in constant and terrible war, both indicate an absence of wisdom on a vast scale. How to roll back this shocking reality is the preoccupation of people of conscience, everywhere. Many are gathered in small groups like ours.</p>

                        <p>As well as our daily practice schedule, we offer eight events throughout the year, when we come together as a community to practice zazen, - sitting meditation -. The timing of the events is not arbitrary, they align with the path of the Earth around the Sun. As such, we mark the equinoxes, the solstices, and the four seasonal events of the Celtic year: Early Spring Festival - Imbolc; May Festival - Bealtaine; High Summer or Harvest Festival - Lúnasa; and Halloween - Samhain. While the core practice is zazen, 
like other zen groups, we also practice walking meditation, cooking and preparing food, sewing, and group study. 
In this way we create opportunities for people throughout the year, to practice attunement with the natural world, alignment of the body-mind with the cosmic order, and to awaken to the now and practice simply being present where we are.</p>

                    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
		    <p>Alain Tainan Liebmann brought zen to Ireland in the early 1990s, he is now the Vice-Abbot of La Gendronnière, the Sotoshu-recognized temple of the Deshimaru Zen lineage in Europe. Alain established the first zen centres in Ireland, in Galway and Dublin, and later, in Cork and Limerick. Since that time there has been continuous zen practice here. Alain´s dharma successor, Jikai Tom Cleary practices and teaches at the Galway Zen Dojo.</p>

		    <p>Here at the Dublin Dojo, renamed Earth+Sky on the installation of Soshin Mary Laheen as a zen teacher in 2019, zen practice continues. We will celebrate 30 years of zen at the Dublin dojo next year. We now include the rich array of teachings and methods of the Maezumi lineage, of which Mary is a teacher. The experience of our recent ancestors and teachers, including Roshi Robert Kennedy, S.J. of Morning Star Zendo, NY and NJ, Roshi Bernie Glassman of the Zen Peacemaker Order, our spiritual friends in the White Plum Asanga, an international affinity group of zen teachers in the Taisan Maezumi lineage, are a constant inspiration to us in our pursuit of the Way.</p>

		    <p>We are closely associated with our spiritual friends here in Ireland, the Galway Zen Dojo, the Grey Heron Sangha in Tallaght, and Black Mountain Zen in Belfast. All of us practice with constancy and dedication, with honesty and compassion.</p>
