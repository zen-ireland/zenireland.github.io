            <h2>SOSHIN MARY LAHEEN</h2>
            <p>Soshin Mary Laheen Roshi is our resident teacher at Earth+Sky Zen. She is an authorised Zen teacher in the Mazeum lineage and member in the White Plum Asanga. She received dharma transmission from her teacher Jinsen Robert Kennedy Roshi in 2019 at a ceremony in Dublin, to teach and transmit the Dharma of the Buddha. In 2025 she was made a Roshi by Jilloen Jaeger.</p>
            <p>Mary began practicing zen in the mid 1990s with Alain Tainan Liebmann, a zen teacher in the Deshimaru lineage, who came to Ireland in 1991. She took Jukai in 1998 and received Tokudo ordination from Alain Liebmann in 2006. From that time she was the person responsible for the Dublin Dojo, which was founded by Alain in 1996.</p>
            <p>After Alain's death Mary travelled to Fukui Province, Japan in the Autumn of 2008 and received Tokudo in the Sohonzi tradition from Natuoka Zenji there in September of that year.</p>
