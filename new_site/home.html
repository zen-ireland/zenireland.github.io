      <h2>SOSHIN MARY LAHEEN</h2>
      <p>Soshin Mary Laheen Roshi is our resident teacher at Earth+Sky Zen. She is an authorised Zen teacher in the
        Maezumi lineage and member of the White Plum Asanga. She received dharma transmission from her teacher Jinsen
        Robert Kennedy Roshi in 2019 at a ceremony in Dublin, to teach and transmit the Dharma of the Buddha. In 2025
        she was made a Roshi by Jinsen.</p>
      <p>Mary began practicing zen in the mid 1990s with Alain Tainan Liebmann, a zen teacher in the Deshimaru lineage,
        who came to Ireland in 1991. She took Jukai in 1998 and received Tokudo ordination from Alain in 2003. From that
        time she was the person responsible for the Dublin Dojo, which was founded by Alain in 1996.</p>
      <p>She lived at Gotanjoji temple in Takefu, Fukui, Japan in the Autumn of 2008 and received Tokudo in the Sotoshu
        tradition from Kōshū Itabashi Zenji there in September of that year.</p>
