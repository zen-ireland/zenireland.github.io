Sunday, November 6th, we welcome you to our Dublin Dojo for a half-day sesshin (meditation retreat).

This is perfect for beginners who would like to experience a longer meditation in a group.

Arrival at 4pm, quick introduction to zazen and kinhin (meditative walking) at 4.15pm.

The first part finishes at 5.30pm with a circle of discussion and opportunity to ask questions.

You are then welcomed to stay for our regular Sunday evening zazen programme 6.15 â€“ 7.30pm.
