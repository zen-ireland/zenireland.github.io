The 'season of mellow fruitfulness' is almost here, the turning of the season from Summer to Autumn will happen this year on Wednesday September 22nd. It's a good time to sit still for a while! All are welcome to join us for the Autumnal Equinox Sesshin, starting Saturday 18th at 8pm, and ending after morning zazen on Monday, 20th September. If you want to come in person please send us an email in advance so that we can arrange everything.
