This weekend we will mark the beginning of Spring with a short Sesshin starting on Saturday evening, January 29th at 8pm, and ending after morning zazen on Monday, January 31st.

The online sesshin format will be the same as that of our zoom retreats together these last couple of years, but it will be also be possible for a small group to sit together in-person at the Dublin Dojo. 

Please send an email if you would like to join us online or in person.![](https://zenireland.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/BRIGID_2022.jpg)
