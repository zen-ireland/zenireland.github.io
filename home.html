      <p>Mary began practicing zen in the mid 1990s with Alain Tainan Liebmann, a zen teacher in the Deshimaru lineage,
        who came to Ireland in 1991. She took Jukai in 1998 and received Shukke Tokudo ordination from Alain in 2003. From that
        time she was the person responsible for the Dublin Dojo, which was founded by Alain in 1996.</p>
