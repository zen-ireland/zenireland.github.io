On March 20th this year the centre of the visible sun will be directly above the equator, and all places on Earth will have equal day and night, - a good time to start practicing equanimity!

All are welcome to join us on sesshin (zen retreat) starting on Saturday evening, March 20th, and ending on Monday morning, March 22nd. For zoom link and programme send an email to zen.in.ireland@gmail.com.
