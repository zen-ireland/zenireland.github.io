On Saturday, June 19, Earth + Sky Zen will host a Zazen Night via zoom, starting at 8pm and ending at 6:30am on Sunday morning. We catch a few hours sleep at midnight. It's an opportunity to appreciate the experience of the shortest (almost) night of the year!

All are welcome. Send us an email if you would like to join, and for information about the zoom link and password.
