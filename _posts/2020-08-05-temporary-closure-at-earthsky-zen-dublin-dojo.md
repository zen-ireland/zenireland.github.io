Due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, the dojo will close temporarily in the interests of 'social distancing'. We want to act in solidarity with everyone in the effort to delay the transmission of the virus, so that vulnerable groups are protected as much as possible.

During this time of isolation you can  join us for zazen through zoom, here are the links:

Morning Zazen, Monday through Thursday at 7:00 am (join about 10 minutes beforehand)

Evening Zazen, on Sundays & Wednesdays at 6:15 pm (join about 10 minutes beforehand)

Remember to turn off your microphone during zazen so that there is less feedback noise
