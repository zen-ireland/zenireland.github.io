On Wednesday morning, March 15th, zazen will be offered online only, there will be no in-person morning zazen, otherwise the dojo will be open at the normal times. 

The dojo will close for the St. Patrick's Day weekend; so no zazen on Sunday evening, March 19th, or Monday morning, March 20th. In-person and online zazen will recommence after the weekend on Tuesday morning at 7:00am.
