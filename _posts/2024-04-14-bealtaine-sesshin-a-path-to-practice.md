At the May bank holiday weekend, Earth+Sky Zen will host a Zazen Day on Saturday, May 4th, and a Sewing Day on Sunday, May 5th. This is an opportunity for people to learn about sewing a rakasu, or to continue to sew one that they have already started. Sewing a rakasu is one aspect of preparing to receive Jukai - also known as 'becoming a bodhisattva', and 'taking the precepts'. The dharma talk on Saturday will outline the process in more detail.![](</img/Bealtaine 2024.jpg>)
