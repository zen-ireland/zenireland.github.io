We are approaching the autumnal
equinox - a time of balance between day and night everywhere on Earth -. 

The traditional wisdom of humankind offers various ways to re-connect with ourselves, with each other and, with the natural world. The wholehearted and embodied practice of zazen is one of these ways. We invite you to join us in an afternoon of zazen practice on Sunday, Sept. 24th, from 3pm – 7:30pm

Sitting in stillness together, we re-connect and re-balance body and mind.

Send an email if you would like to join us.
