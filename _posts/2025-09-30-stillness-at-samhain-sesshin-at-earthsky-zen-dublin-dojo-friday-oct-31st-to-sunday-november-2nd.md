Erin Mullally in her essay *Looking for the roots of Halloween in Ireland’s Boyne Valley *says, “The Celtic festival of Samhain, the period from sunset on October 31st to sunset on November 1st, marks the beginning of winter and the transition to a new year. The ancient Celts believed that this night marked a critical spiritual transition, when the spirits of all who had died since the previous *Oíche Shamhna* (Night of Samhain) moved on to the next life.” 

At Earth+Sky we will mark the occasion with a sesshin, beginning on Friday evening with zazen at 7:30pm and ending after lunch on Sunday. See poster and timetable here.
