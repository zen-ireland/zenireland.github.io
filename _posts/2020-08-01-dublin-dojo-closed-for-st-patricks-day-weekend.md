The Dublin dojo will close from Saturday, March 14th until 7:00 am Wednesday morning, March 18th. 
We are conscious of participating in the national effort to delay the spread of COVID-19, and of taking prudent measures to avoid community transmission. At the moment the zazen timetable is unchanged, as the dojo is spacious enough to accommodate the group who practice morning and evening. We'll keep the situation under review.
