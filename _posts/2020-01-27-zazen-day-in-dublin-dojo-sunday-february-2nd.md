There will be Zazen Days at the Dublin Dojo on Sunday, February 2nd led by Mary Soshin Laheen. 

It will begin at 11am and end around 7:30pm after Sunday evening zazen. Organic vegetarian lunch is provided. In the afternoon we clean the dojo, sometimes we do T'ai Chi exercises in between zazen. There is a short dharma talk / teisho.
Daisan (a one to one meeting) is offered if people wish to participate.

We accept donations to help cover costs. â‚¬20 donation for the day is suggested. No one should stay away for lack of funds.
