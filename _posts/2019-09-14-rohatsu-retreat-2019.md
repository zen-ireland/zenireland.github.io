A week long silent meditation retreat commemorating the Buddha's enlightenment will be held in Esker Redemptorist Monastery, Athenry, Co. Galway from the 30th November to 7th December 2019.

This sesshin will be led by Alain Liebmann.

Alain is currently teaching in France and leading sesshins in a few other countries. He lived in Ireland for over twenty years and introduced many people to zazen. He is one of the students of Master Deshimaru and received Dharma Transmission from Koshu Itabashi Zenji.

We don't recommend this event for beginners as it's intense.
