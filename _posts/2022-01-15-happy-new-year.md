Áthbhliain faoi mhaise daoibh go léir!![](https://zenireland.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mountain.jpg)

From Tuesday January 4th, we have begun to zoom zazen again from Earth + Sky at the Dublin dojo. The physical dojo will remain closed until the end of January. 

Please contact us by email if you would like to join us online.

Despite the uncertainty that the pandemic brings we continue to plan practice events with our friends at Galway Zen Dojo, and the Grey Heron Sangha. 

Our programme of events for the year includes two weeks of sesshin on the Aran Islands in August. Alain Liebmann will join us for the second week. Roshi Kennedy will come to Ireland at the end of August for a sesshin with Grey Heron Sangha, and will spend the month of September with us at Earth + Sky.

We look forward to practicing with you all in 2022!
